# Reinforcement Learning Environments for your next Research Project

RL Environments (RLEnvs) are a complex topic, since we can make an environment to model pretty much anything we want (if we are happy to take the trade-offs). More complete lists of possible environments have been made for example [awesome-ai-environments](https://github.com/dbobrenko/awesome-ai-environments) and [awesome-rl-envs](https://github.com/clvrai/awesome-rl-envs). The aim of the below is therefore not to provide an exhaustive list but to provide a quick reference for selecting an environment that may suit your research problem, useful for proof of concepts and experimentation.
