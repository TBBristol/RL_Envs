# Reinforcement Learning Environments for your next Research Project

RL Environments (RLEnvs) are a complex topic since we can make an environment to model pretty much anything we want (if we are happy to take the trade-offs). More complete lists of possible environments have been made for example [awesome-ai-environemnts](https://github.com/dbobrenko/awesome-ai-environments) and [awesome-rl-envs](https://github.com/clvrai/awesome-rl-envs)
